%RegressionPartitionedModel Cross-validated regression model.
%   RegressionPartitionedModel is a set of regression models trained on
%   cross-validated folds. You can obtain a cross-validated model either by
%   calling CROSSVAL method of a regression model or by training a
%   regression model with one of the cross-validation options.
%
%   To estimate the quality of regression by cross-validation, you can
%   use KFOLD methods. Every KFOLD method uses models trained on in-fold
%   observations to predict response for out-of-fold observations. For
%   example, you cross-validate using 5 folds. In this case, every training
%   fold contains roughly 4/5 of data and every test fold contains roughly
%   1/5 of data. The first model stored in Trained{1} was trained on X and
%   Y with the first 1/5 excluded, the second model stored in Trained{2}
%   was trained on X and Y with the second 1/5 excluded and so on. When you
%   call KFOLDPREDICT, it computes predictions for the first 1/5 of the
%   data using the first model, for the second 1/5 of data using the second
%   model and so on. In short, response for every observation is computed by
%   KFOLDPREDICT using the model trained without this observation.

        %RESPONSETRANSFORM Transformation applied to predicted regression response.
        %   The ResponseTransform property is a string describing how raw
        %   regression response predicted by the model is transformed. You can
        %   assign a function handle or one of the following strings to this
        %   property: 'none', 'doublelogit', 'identity', 'invlogit', 'ismax',
        %   'logit', 'sign', 'symmetricismax', 'symmetriclogit', and 'symmetric'.
        %   You can use either 'identity' or 'none' for the identity
        %   transformation.

        %   model OBJ. For every fold, this method computes regression loss for

        %
        %   L=KFOLDLOSS(OBJ,'PARAM1',val1,'PARAM2',val2,...) specifies optional
        %   parameter name/value pairs:
        %       'folds'            - Indices of folds ranging from 1 to KFold. Use
        %                            only these folds for predictions. By default,
        %                            all folds are used.
        %       'mode'             - 'average' (default) or 'individual'. If
        %                            'average', this method averages over all
        %                            folds. If 'individual', this method returns a
        %                            vector with one element per fold.
        %       'lossfun'          - Function handle for loss, or string
        %                            representing a built-in loss function.
        %                            Available loss functions for regression:

        %                            calls it as shown below:
        %                               FUN(Y,Yfit,W)
        %                            where Y, Yfit and W are numeric vectors of
        %                            length N. Y is observed response, Yfit is
        %                            predicted response, and W is observation
        %                            weights. Default: 'mse'
